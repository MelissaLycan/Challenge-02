            <p>I have worked most of my life in the private sector in Sales and Management. After repeated success my passions took me into the music business. Over a decade in music and a Bachelor of Science in Music Business and I began to see trends everywhere.  This sparked a passion inside me for BigDATA and I raced to attain a Masters in BI, where I discovered my love for math, strategy and logic all over again.  Over the last 5 years I have taught HS Math in Denver.  Currently I am honing my development skills and finishing certification in Full Stack Development so that I may build my own concepts and contribute to the greater accomplishments of mankind with my skills and talents.  </p><br>
            <h3>Core Values</h3>
            <p>I believe in people and their incredible ability to be blissfully vulnerable and intensely strong all in the same moment.  I believe creativity is the ultimate expression of this lifetime, whether it is coding, music, writing, painting or whatever you so choose.  I am driven by unconditional love, a desire to constantly accept feedback that will improve my character and perspective, and a wanderlust for adventure and exploration that can only be atributed to a deep seeded ancestral calling.</p><br>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>There are many concepts that are universal, build your own game, build your own app, build your own platform.  I have an ambition to do all three. 
            Having lead diverse teams in Corporate America and in Education I have an ultimate goal to lead teams in tech.
